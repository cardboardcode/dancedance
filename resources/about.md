# About Us
---

We are a team based in the [School of Computing, National University of Singapore](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), doing this project for our [CG3002](https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/cors/jsp/report/ModuleDetailedInfo.jsp?acad_y=2014/2015&sem_c=1&mod_c=CG3002) module. Our product revolves around detection of specific dance moves through non-optical devices such as accelerometers and gyroscope. We hope our product would yield positive societal impacts which could come in the form of promoting a healthier life-style via dancing.
